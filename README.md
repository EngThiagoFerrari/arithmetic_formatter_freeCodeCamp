# Arithmetic Formatter

This is the boilerplate for the Arithmetic Formatter project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter

Message from Thiago Ferrari  
This boilerplate brings all the necessary files for running and testing the program.
The only file I edited was the "arithmetic_arranger.py" where I wrote the python program following the instructions stated on freeCodeCamp.org link mentioned above.  

The file main.py imports the arithmetic_arranger.py to be exceuted. I also starts the test_module.py - where I could check whether or not I met all of the project's requirements.
